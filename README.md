A CSS and Javascript clock based on day 2 of Wes Bos' "30 days of Javascript"

Current stage:

** ==================== v02 ==================== **

Design an input area made of buttons, on which the user can click to change the clock's style (round, square, bars, etc.)

---------------------------------------------------

Further possible stages:

v03) Design different background styles for each clock style and implement them

v04) Implementation of a timer function, based on user input

v05) Implementation of a stopwatch function

---------------------------------------------------

Completed stages: 

v01) Design and implementation of a clock, whose hands rotate to indicate the current local time 

- Responsive but not optimized for small screens (below 500px)
- Only one JS file, structured upon a module pattern (data controller, ui controller, general controller)
